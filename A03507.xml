            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The thickeſt Trees in Paradiſe could not hide our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> from the preſence of God.

               <p>Wee cannot then hide our ſinnes, becauſe which way ſoeuer wee goe, our conſcience accompanieth vs; it is our Porter, carr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it whatſoeuer we haue done, be it good or bad; it iudgeth all our words and workes, and pronounceth inward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of vs all: it is a Worme alwayes byting, and neuer dying: it is a fire alwayes burning, and

               <p>Therefore when thine owne Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth thee, and prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a feeling of ſinne: thinke then with thy ſelfe, God ſpeaketh vnto thee: for that inward feeling of thy ſinne, is as it were the peculiar and prerogatiue Court of God, whereby he exerciſeth his iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Beware therefore leſt thou beeing guilty, doeſt harden thy heart; for that

So that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, your reckoning is the ſooner made, your Conſcience diſcharged, and the world ſatisfied: neither need you to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troubled with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters, if God lay his hand more heauily vpon you, but onely thinke of heauenly things. Tell me therefore haue you made your Will?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I haue made none yet, but I purpoſe to doe hereafter, if I feele my

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. O good Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you muſt thinke that you are already far wrong, and farre from right and reaſon too, if you deferre the diſpoſing of your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things vntill the laſt gaſpe, when peraduenture both your ſpeech and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie ſhall faile you: now you may and will not, then you would &amp; perhaps can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: many haue ſo done and repented too late, euen then when it had bin more fit to haue minded heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things onely. Therefore (I beſeech you) take the good time and occaſion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15322:23"/> which God preſently offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: if hee giue you life and memory this day, or this weeke, you know not whether you ſhall haue it the next weeke or no: if you put the good time off, which GOD hath giuen you, and deferre your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe till this day, or that day, or vntill this friend come, or that kinſman be preſent; then peraduenture your friends ſhall come too late, and you your ſelfe be cut ſhort of your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Therefore beware in the Name of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, for you know not whether God wil giue you
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15322:24"/> the like occaſion againe or no: you may purpoſe, but God will diſpoſe both you and your wealth as he will: when you are once gone, your riches are none of yours, but the worlds, and are at the diſpoſition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, who by corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may deale vnfaithfully, and ſo contrarie to your will, your ſubſtance which you haue ſwea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Lord, Lord, ſee how forgetfull men bee of their dutie in time of their Sicknes! I beſeech you Sir, beare with my weakneſſe: I confeſſe I was out of the way in this point, but you haue brought me vnto it, and to a further conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my ſtate: I muſt needs ſay your counſell is good and comfortable: and therefore I were a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnreaſonable perſon, if I ſhould not be ordered by you to mine owne good.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15322:25"/> Wherefore I purpoſe now (God willing) to do as you haue ſaid, with your better aduice, and others of my friends. And therefore I pray you take paines to ſet my minde downe in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: and ſo that matter beeing diſpatched, I will then commend my ſelfe both bodie and ſoule vnto God the giuer of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the Author of life.</p>

               <head>A pithy Prayer for a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent being pained with Sicknes.</head>
               <p>IT is thou, O Lord, onely to whom all power and praiſe belongeth. It is thou that raigneſt in heauen in glorie, in earth in mercy, &amp; in hel in iudgment. It is thy voice, O Lord, whereunto both the ſeas and windes are obedient. It is thy name, O Lord God of Hoſts, that maketh all the Diuels in hell to tremble and quake: and they can doe nothing without thy permiſſion. Thou bringeſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:15322:63"/> downe to hell, and raiſeſt vp againe. Thou pluckeſt downe the mighty from their Throne, and exalteſt the humble and meeke. Thou makeſt both poore and rich, ſtrong &amp; weake. Thou ſendeſt ſicknes, and reſtoreſt health againe in thy good time. Thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt life, and takeſt it away at thy pleaſure. O Lord, whoſe maieſtie and might no creature is able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, neither in heauen, earth, or vnder the earth: Thou that haſt made the Sea and the dry land, and all things therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Thou that knoweſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:15322:64"/> our weakneſſe, and what metall wee bee made of: haue regard vnto the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of thy hands: Pierce the heauens, O Lord, and giue eare vnto our prayers, which with ſorrowfull hearts, trickling teares, bowed knees, and vnfained lips we powre out before thy preſence. We acknowledge (O Lord) our owne frailetie and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, and how that all men liuing are but vanitie, euen as the graſſe in the field, which to day flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and to morrow withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth away, as the ſmoke in the furnace, the bubble in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:15322:64"/> the water, or the could that ſwiftly paſſeth away and is no more ſeene: So ſoone alſo fedeth away our time, and our yeeres come to an end. Thou onely (O Lord) knoweſt the number of our dayes, and appointeſt vs our bounds which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſſe. We confeſſe (O moſt mercifull God) that wee haue ſinned againſt heauen, and againſt thee, and are no more worthy to be called thy children, no nor to tread vpon the earth, or to haue the light of the Sunne to ſhine vpon vs: but rather to bee burned with fire, drowned in the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:15322:65"/> waters, ſwallowed vp of the earth, ouerwhelmed with mountaines, or deuoured with wilde beaſts &amp; fowles of the ayre. Our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſinnes are ſo great, ſo grieuous, and many in number, wherewithall wee haue and doe dayly offend thy Maieſtie, both in thought, word, and deed, that our weake conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being loden and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them, are afraid to approch into thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, for feare of thy wrath and iuſt iudgement. Yet (O Lord) forſomuch as thy mercy is aboue all thy
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:15322:65"/> workes, and becauſe thou art a gentle &amp; pitifull God, long-ſuffering, and full of compaſſion, and wouldeſt not the death of a ſinner, but rather that hee conuert and liue. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bolder not of our ſelues, but in the name of thy deare Son Ieſus Chriſt (with whom thou art well pleaſed) to call vpon thee for mercy and comfort: That it would pleaſe thee of thy gracious goodnes to forgiue and blot out of thy remembrance all our ſinnes and wickednes, and neuer hereafter to impute them vnto vs. Regard not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:15322:66"/> (good Lord) our deſerts which is death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but be mindfull of thy louing promiſes in Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour, who in all temptations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, the World, and the Fleſh, is our onely Rocke, and ſure ſtay and defence, and neuer ſhrinketh from thoſe which be wrapped in woe and miſery. Comfort (O Lord) this thy Seruant, vpon whom thou haſt laid the ſcourge of ſicknes, and rod of viſitation, as a ſure token and pledge of thy loue, and fatherly good wil towards him: for whom thou loueſt, thoſe thou cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteſt,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:15322:66"/> not to deſtruction, but to amendment and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Thou haſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that whereſoeuer two or three are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in thy name, thou wilt grant their requeſts. We (therefore thy humble ſeruants) here aſſembled according to thy bleſſed commandement, doe cry and call vpon thee with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant hearts, to be mercifull to this thine afflicted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it would pleaſe thee eyther to releaſe his ſmart and pain in thy good time, and ſo to reſtore him to his former health, or elſe to grant him aboundantly

               <p>The Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> cryed, and her Daughter was cured. The Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beleeued, and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant was made whole. The Father prayed, and his Sonne was clenfed of the foule ſpirit. The Apoſtles cryed out, Helpe Lord, for wee periſh: and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way they were deliuered. Chriſt perceiued but the Faith of the people; and he ſaid to the ſicke of the Palſie, Be of good cheere, my ſonne, thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and her companions doe but weepe, and her ſonne is raiſed from death

A poore blinde man cryed out, O Son of <hi>Dauid,</hi> haue mercy on me, and he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his ſight. The Thiefe hanging on the Croſſe, ſaid but onely, Lord remember me: and Chriſt anſwered, This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe. O ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Faith of ſinners! what man hath at any time cried Ieſu haue mercy on mee; but forthwith hee hath found fauour, &amp; obtained
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:15322:72"/> grace. A ſure faith procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth any thing at Gods hands; but he that miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Phyſician, hindreth his owne health. Our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt hath opened vnto vs the gate of his goodnes: therefore let not vs runne headlong to the dungeon of deſperation, the dunghill of the Diuell. Hee hath ſtretched out his hand to vs; therefore let not vs turne away our face from him.

For whoſe cauſe doth the Sun ſhine by day, the Moone and the Starres by night, but for man? For whoſe ſake doth the Lord water the earth with deaw drops and ſhowres of raine, but for man? Why blowe the Windes? Why runne the Riuers? Why ſpread the Springs? Why budde the Trees? Why growe the fruits of the earth? And why increaſe the fiſhes of the ſeas, but for the vſe of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:15322:73"/> man? He is King and Lord of all creatures vnder the cope of heauen. There is nothing that God hath not made ſubiect to man, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee would that man ſhould bee obedient vnto him. Yet many times our mercifull God ſendeth vs aduerſitie, eyther to cleere vs of our tranſgreſſions, or to feare vs from ſinne, or to miniſter occaſion of well-doing. Thus was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> tryed: So was <hi>Iob</hi> proued with many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: Thus is euery one which liueth godly in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> tryed in this world with ſundry afflictions, as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:15322:73"/> the gold in the fire: for whom the Lord loueth, thoſe he chaſteneth.</p>
               <p>Therefore (wee beſeech thee, O Lord) aſſiſt vs by thy might and mercy, that we may patiently beare all trouble, neede, pouertie, ſicknes, ſlander, hatred, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, griefe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of minde, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our deadly Enemy, loſſe of lands, and worldly wealth, and all other cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

               <p>And that wee may the better performe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, let vs in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſet theſe foure things before our eyes, that is, the Day of Death, the Day of Doome, that Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wicked, and the Saluation of the godly.</p>
               <p>To the wicked and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſort, death is miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Gods Iudgements ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and their paine into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable: To the godly and ſuch as ſhal be ſaued, death is pleaſant, iudgement comfortable, and their ioy perpetuall: therefore it is better betime to repent &amp; reforme our ſelues with the

               <p>I purpoſe not to ſpeake
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:15322:108"/> much of eyther, for if I did, I ſhould but make the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of this book to large, and ſo cauſe the Printer to waſte paper, to his further charges, and my greater paines, and yet ſay nothing but that which is ſet downe already by thoſe that are better learned then my ſelf, and haue troden the way before mee. Therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing partly touched the ſame in my Queſtions, I wil only adde theſe few lines following, touching both for example ſake.</p>
               <p>It is an old rule in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick: <hi>Take away the cauſe, and the effect is taken away
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:15322:108"/> with it.</hi> Vnderſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (good Brother) that the cauſes why men ſo much feare death, be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men and their manners.</p>
               <p>The firſt cauſe is, for that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by death they loſe many commodities and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which in their life time they did long enioy, and haue great delight therein; as wife, children, parents, friends, lands, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, poſſeſſions, ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſes, buildings, worldly honours, offices &amp; dignities. All theſe and ſuch like, be call-backs, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:15322:109"/> dayly coueted while life laſteth, and yet dreadfull death diſpatcheth vs of all theſe delights euen at a blow: this is the feare of worldlings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we feare death, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe of weakeneſſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and bitter torments, which are the forerunners, warners, and meſſengers of death: This is the feare of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe why men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> feare death, is, incredulity or lack of faith in Chriſt. This is the feare of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and proceedeth of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or lack of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Scriptures,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:15322:109"/> whereof our faith is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>The fourth cauſe why <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> we feare death, is, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of eternall damnation both of body and ſoule in hell fire. This is the inward feare of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>But to bee ſhort, one comfortable blaſt of Gods ſpirit, will extinguiſh and driue all theſe terrours quite away from vs, euen as the winde doth driue away the thick clowds or miſts, which do ſeparate vs from the light and ſight of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> loſſe of the world, and all
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:15322:110"/> the droſſe therein, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede no loſſe, but gaine to thoſe that by death enioy the company of God &amp; his Angels in heauen, where they ſhall be immortall and incorruptible; freed from all carnall deſires and diſeaſes of the body, and deliuered from all ſorrow and trouble of minde: no loſſe therefore to the godly that haue gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Chriſt, but to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worldlings that haue loſt their riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures here, &amp; in ſtead therof poſſeſſe perpetuall paines elſewhere, to them it ſhall bee ſaid: <hi>Looke how much pleaſure they haue had, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:15322:110"/> giue them ſo much torment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, touching the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> feare of ſickneſſe, the more paine wee ſuffer heere, the more like wee are to our Maſter Chriſt, &amp; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall bee our reward in heauen: In the meane time, let vs be of good comfort, for he that ſmiteth, healeth, and hee that ſendeth trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſendeth ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, againſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or diſtruſt, wee muſt deſire of God to increaſe our faith, that wee may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Scriptures, and take pleaſure therein: for ignorance will not excuſe vs, now that the candle is
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:15322:111"/> lighted and not hid vnder a buſhell, but openly reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the wide world, and that to the comfort and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of euery one that beleeueth: for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods Law, and the Goſpell, are neceſſary to our ſaluation: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be diuers.</p>
               <p>The one doth feare vs.</p>
               <p>The other doth comfort vs.</p>
               <p>The Law vttereth ſinne.</p>
               <p>The Goſpell forgiueth it.</p>
               <p>The Law maketh weake.</p>
               <p>The Goſpell maketh ſtrong.</p>
               <p>The Law killeth.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:15322:111"/>
               <p>The Goſpell quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>The Law throweth down to hell.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel lifteth vp to heauen.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, againſt the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> feare of damnation, when Satan layeth the Law hard to our charge, threatning thereby death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Let vs anſwere him with the Goſpell, which bringeth life and ſaluation. Let vs haue a grounded and ſtedfaſt faith fixed in Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, who hath vanquiſhed and deſtroyed all our deadly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as the fleſh, the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:15322:112"/> world, damnation, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, dangers, ſin, death, deuill and hell.</p>
               <p>Be at vtter defiance with them all, &amp; ſay boldly with the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul, It is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33.</note>

               <p>But (alas) what meaneth this? There is nothing that men ſo often behold as death, and nothing that men ſo ſoone forget as death. As men ought not to bee careleſſe of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall end: ſo they ought not to feare death, eſpecially if they haue liued in the feare of God; for ſeeing all muſt dye, wherefore ſhould the godly be afraid of Bugges?
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:15322:114"/> what a foole is he that will feare his owne ſhadow? what good will it doe vs, either to complaine or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that thing which by no meanes wee can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape?</p>
               <p>Tell me, if thou canſt, with all thy skill, what man is he aliue, that breatheth vpon the earth, that ſhall liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee bee an hundreth yeeres old? or, what one canſt thou name for thy life, with whom thou haſt beene acquainted an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeeres ſithens? crack me this Nut, reade me this Riddle, <hi>Et eris mihi magnus Apollo:</hi> that is, I wil account
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:15322:114"/> thee as a God for thy skill. Seeing then that our life is both ſhort and vncertaine, and that theſe things are generall to all, and not to thee or to me alone; Why ſhould we not in good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip taſte of the ſame ſawce, and drinke of the ſame cup one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that without feare or grudging, as all our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors haue done? Let vs yeeld our pampred bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the earth, and our ſinfull ſoules to the tryall of iuſtice: for ſo haue the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alwayes done, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the world to be but a Race, a Vale of miſeries,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:15322:115"/> and a paineful Pilgrimage, and therefore they couet to haue the courſe of this life finiſhed, they waite conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for the good houre, looking after death for a ioyfull reſurrection. And of this hope they haue the ſweete and comfortable Teſtimony of Gods Spirit within them, as a gage or pledge of their ſaluation, which will neuer forſake them, vntill it haue preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of God, as heires and coheires with Ieſus Chriſt of his heauenly Kingdome, purchaſed for vs with his owne bloud, wherein our
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:15322:115"/> ſoules and filthy bodies are ſprinkled and thorowly waſhed. What a comfort is this to a Chriſtian heart? What neede a man thus minded to feare death after this life, any more then the laboring man (after he hath toyled ſore al the day long) neede to feare ſleepe and his quiet reſt at night? No, no, hee may rather with a cheerefull conſcience wiſh for death, becauſe as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He ſhall paſse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Let vs therefore (good Chriſtian Brother) ſo liue with Chriſt, that we may dye in him; and let vs ſo
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:15322:116"/> glorifie him in this life by our godly conuerſation, that wee may bee glorified of him in the life to come, to our comfort and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The beſt remedy to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid this friuolous feare of death, is to repent our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſinnes, and hereafter to apply our ſelues to liue in his true ſeruice and feare.</p>

               <p>Secondly, that wee may receiue at Gods hands in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the reſurrection of the iuſt, a comfortable and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgement.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:15322:116"/>
               <p>Thirdly, that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the horrible paines of hell which are intolerable.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and finally, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> we may be partakers of the life euerlaſting, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: which God vouchſafe to grant vnto vs for his Chriſts ſake, our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and mercifull Sauiour,</p>

               <p>Now therefore (good Brother) in the time of this your tryall and Viſitation, I would wiſh you to apply theſe comfortable ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and examples to your ſelfe, for the better ſafety of your owne ſoule.

               <p>Firſt, therefore, I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in God the Father, the firſt Perſon in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; who by his vnſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wiſedome, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power, hath mightily made me and all mankind; yea, heauen, earth, the Sea, and all things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: as the light of the Firmament, the Sunne,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:15322:135"/> Moone, and Starres, the Fowles of the Ayre, the Beaſts of the Field, the fruits of the Earth, and the fiſhes of the Sea. All theſe of his great goodnes hee hath made, bleſſed, and increaſed for man to doe him ſeruice, and that in moſt wonderfull and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull manner. Yea, they were all created before man was made, to the end that Man at his firſt entry into the world, ſhould come (as it were) into a houſe ready furniſhed, and ſo take full and quiet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and become Lord
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:15322:135"/> and Ruler ouer them: and they all from time to time to be ſeruiceable vnto him as to their King.

               <p>Secondly, I beleeue in God the Son, the ſecond

Yet I firmely beleeue that I am acquitted, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and fully ranſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the ſame, by my ſweet Sauior Ieſus Chriſt, that did ſweat water and bloud for my ſinne; who willingly of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:15322:136"/> came down from the ſeate of his Maieſty in the higheſt heauens, into the vile and ſtinking bowels of the earth, where he for my ſake, and all his elect, did not abhorre to take fleſh of the pure Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and became man, and in the ſame fleſh, ſuffered moſt bitter paine and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being condemned by an earthly iudge, to the moſt ſhamefull death of the Croſſe, and ſo was buried, and deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, riſing againe for our iuſtification, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into heauen, for our glorification, and to

And this (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:15322:137"/> many others) is a ſingular comfort to me, to know aſſuredly that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall bee my iudge, but he that is the Sauiour of my ſoule, and ſuffered for my ſinnes. So that in all my perplexitie, perill, and danger, I ſet this Ieſus a Sauiour before mine eyes, as a ſhield, a buckler, and ſure wall between me and my ſpirituall ſoe the Diuel, and all his tyranny, aſſuring my ſelfe by this confidence, that neither he by his cruelty, nor all the Armie of hell can euer hurt or harme me, or any of Gods Elect.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:15322:138"/>
               <p>Thirdly, I beleeue in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God the holy Ghoſt, the third Perſon in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; who by his grace lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly preſerueth and ſanctifieth mee and all the Elect people of God, who dayly gouerneth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth mee in all my wayes and godly actions, who ſealeth vp my ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the ſtedfaſt hope that I haue in Chriſt Ieſus, aſſuring me inwardly, that all his benefits are mine, and by that meanes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me apply the ſame to the comfort of my ſoule, who alſo mortifieth ſinne in me, who openeth and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:15322:138"/> expoundeth vnto mee the diuine myſteries of God, and moueth me to leade a godly life.</p>
               <p>This is that bleſſed wind which bloweth where it liſteth, euen the Spirit of God, which of carnall, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs ſpirituall; of cruell, meeke; of malicious, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable; of couetous, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; of diſſolute, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; of fooliſh, wiſe; of earthly, heauenly; of the bondſlaues of Satan, the deare ſonnes of GOD, whereby wee may boldly cry, Abba Father. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that this holy Ghoſt is the earneſt penny here
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:15322:139"/> on earth, of my ſaluation in heauen, and that hee will neuer forſake mee, no not in the houre of death and my greateſt danger: but that hee will comfort me continually in all woe and temptations: ſo that although I bee tryed by the touchſtone of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, grieued with extreme paine of bodie, or torinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with inward vexation of minde; yet I ſhall not be ouercome, neither ſhall my croſſe be greater then I ſhal be able to beare and endure. For I know aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, that this holy Ghoſt wil mercifully preſerue me
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:15322:139"/> both in body and ſoule vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the comming of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt to iudgment, at the dreadfull day of doome, and there preſent me holy and without blame, before his Throne of grace, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of my ſelfe vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,) yet this ſweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15, 16.</note> doth, of his eſpeciall grace, beare witnes with my ſpirit and conſcience, and that in moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table manner, that I am of the number of thoſe which ſhall be ſaued, and that I ſhall ſtand in the laſt day on the right hand of Chriſt, and heare that

               <p>All theſe three perſons before rehearſed, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue to bee one God in

               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:15322:141"/>
               <p>Fourthly, and finally, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> doe beleeue the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, which is Gods Elect people, or the Congregation of the faithfull, and is called the Kingdome of Chriſt Ieſus. Of this Kingdome, Chriſt<note place="margin">Apoc. 21.</note> onely is Prince; of this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Chriſt onely is Head; and of this Spouſe, Chriſt onely is the Bridegroome. This Church is called the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, a ſpirituall Houſe, a holy Nation, a Royall Prieſthood, the Citizens of Heauen, the Pillar of Truth, the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Saints:

               <p>This Church is knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and vnited by faith, through the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt, as members of one bodie.</p>
               <p>This Church hath the pure Word of God truely and ſincerely preached, and the Sacraments duely and faithfully adminiſtred

               <p>I proteſt and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that I haue beene a grieuous and horrible ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all my dayes, both in thought, word, and deede: And that I haue not liued ſo vpright and holy before

I acknowledge my offences to be mo in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then the Starres of Heauen, or the ſands in the Sea: for my negligence in not doing that which is good, and my dayly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, in committing the things which are euill, are infinite.

               <p>I proteſt furthermore, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that I do beleeue, that this

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:15322:147"/> and that the vertue of this Paſsion of Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not onely to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but alſo to me.</p>
               <p>I proteſt before the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God, and before all his holy. Angels and Saints, that I couet &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to end my life in that faith, which becommeth a true Chriſtian, and the Child of God: That is, I beleeue all the Canonicall Scriptures mentioned in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſet downe by the holy Prophets of God, and the Apoſtles of his Sonne Chriſt, as the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and writers; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct

               <p>Finally, I proteſt, that I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> reioyce in Spirit, for the ſweet mercy and merits which I feele inwardly to bee offered mee, by the death of Chriſt Ieſus.

Wel, what is to bee done in this wofull caſe? Wee muſt comfort our ſelues with ſentences and examples, which are written for our inſtruction in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

               <p>Thus alſo the Vulgar ſort, when they ſee men torne in pieces with diuers kinde of torments; as Whipping, Racking, Hanging, Burning, &amp;c. willingly to take their death, yea, and to wearie their Tormentors and Hangmen, with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible

But they cry, they mourne, they fret, they fume, they ſweare, they rage, they blaſpheme God, and reuile men: They deſpayre, and are ſwallowed vp of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.

Therefore the more wee

The more the Gold is beaten, the better it is: The more the iron is rubbed with the fyle, the brighter it is: The more the corneis threſhed and fanned, the cleerer it is: So the more that God tryeth vs in the furnace of tribulation, the more hee loueth vs, and the more we glorifie him.</p>
               <p>A Veſſell, if it be foule, muſt bee ſcowred before Wine be put in it: and be that will make his ground fruitfull, muſt firſt pull vp the weedes, before hee ſowe good ſeede: Euen ſo

               <p>The good Corne for a time lyeth vnder the Chaffe, Flowers grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong weedes, and the ſweet Roſe that ſmelleth, commeth vp with the ſharpe Thorne that prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: So the godly for a time are kept vnder, and vexed with the wicked, and oftentimes God doth more puniſh them with pouertie, paine, and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then he doth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:15322:171"/> weeds of the world: but all this is for out good, to make vs more obedient in dutie towards his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. And therfore all theſe croſſes and loſſes, are pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently of our parts to bee ſuffred, as infallible tokens of Gods loue.</p>
               <p>Let no man therefore caſt downe his heart in ſicknes, or any other afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for hee that ſmiteth, healeth; &amp; he that ſendeth trouble, giueth ſtrength; and againſt euery extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie God hath prepared a remedy, that fearefull man ſhould not diſtruſt Gods carefull prouidence;

               <p>I would aske one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:) What could theſe villanous Iewes, &amp; ſworne enemies of our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus haue done more againſt him, if hee had beene the vileſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon the earth; the arranteſt thiefe in the world; or the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in Hell?

               <p>Now what ſaith Chriſt to this geare? or what dooth Hee to his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors? Doth hee goe roundly to worke with them? or doth he handle them in their kinde? that is, Doth he cauſe the earth to open her mouth and ſwallow them vp aliue, as vnworthy men to liue any longer therein? Or doth hee command fire from Heauen to deſtroy them as they well deſerued? Or doth hee of himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:15322:195"/> them preſently to hell fire, as he could if he would?</p>
               <p>No verily, no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee ſuffereth them thus farre forth: He bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and yet curſeth not: he ſeeketh ſtill to ſaue, and not to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>O mercifull Chriſt! O Prince of Peace, and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of patience! VVhat man is hee this day that beareth breath in his body (if he be fleſh and bloud) that is able to ſuffer ſuch torment, without offering any ſtroke or one froward word? Chriſt doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which might and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:15322:195"/> could haue done both: but he came to ſuffer, and not to ſmite: for his death gaue life to his enemies; yea, they that ſhed the bloud of Chriſt, were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the bloud of Chriſt. Such was his loue, ſuch was his patience, that he ſuffered all theſe things for our ſake. His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes couered our filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; his labour, lightned our loade; his ſhame, was our ioy; and his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was our Saluation.</p>
               <p>But O ſtiffenecked Iewes! O cruell Crucifiers! O corrupt Iudge! O wicked world, that wrought this
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:15322:196"/> woe vpon him, that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for thy ſinne! Is this thy thankefulneſſe for ſo great a benefit? Is this thy reward for the worke of Saluation?</p>
               <p>Tell mee one thing, but tell me truely. Haſt thou any reaſon to wound him, that healed thee; to binde him, that looſed thee; to condemne him, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee; to deride him, that redeemed thee; and to hang him that helped thee? Let Heauen, let Earth, let Hell it ſelfe cry out againſt this crueltie. O wicked Nation! O proud Citie Ieruſalem, and O in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:15322:196"/> Chriſt! his death declared his innocencie. The earth trembled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at: the Elements were troubled: the Starres were abaſhed: yea, all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Heauen were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: the Moone gaue no light. the Sunne ſhined not: but darknes cloſed vp the light of the day, leſt the Sunne ſhould bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to behold the bloudy and cruell fact of the Iewes. The Temple rent in twaine: the ſtones claue in ſunder: the Graues ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the dead bodies did riſe: inſomuch that the beholders of his Paſſion,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:15322:197"/> and ſome of thoſe which conſented to his death, and wiſhed that his bloud might light vpon them, and their children, are now ſo wounded in heart, and pricked in conſcience, that they now change their minde, ſing a new ſong, and confeſſe indeed hee was the Sonne of God. They now become blanke, which before were ſo bold. They now accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Chriſt. They now wiſh him aline againe with a wring by the eare, which before crucified him. They now lament,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:15322:197"/> which before laughed. They now mourne, which before mocked. They now knocke their breſts full of heauines, with teares in their eyes, water on their cheekes, and ſorrow in their hearts, which before ſhaked their heads, ſpet in his face, called him wretch, and cryed fie vpon him. I will ſay no more, eyther of Chriſt, either of any Prophet before him, or Martyr that ſhall come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as of late there haue been many: but conclude all that haue beene, are, or ſhall bee, in one round Ring, ſeemely Circle, and
